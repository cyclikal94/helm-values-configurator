todo:
- [ ] Pasting YAML updates UI key/value pairs
- [x] Change the pin icon so it works like the warning/error tooltips/icons in the key/value objects
- [ ] Make drop-downs pickup default values OR hidden empty
- [ ] Pickup default key/value pairs & arrays

Maybe should just set the YAML to the `values.yaml`, sync with the UI, then hide everything that's defualt. But this wouldn't pickup key/values yet.
